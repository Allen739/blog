# How to Create Interactive Blog Posts with MDX

Welcome to your new blog platform! This guide will teach you how to create rich blog posts using MDX.

## Getting Started

All blog posts live in the `content/` directory as `.mdx` files. Each post needs frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Title"
publishedAt: "2026-02-16"
summary: "A brief summary of your post."
---
```

## Writing Content

You can write content in standard Markdown format:

- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks with triple backticks

## Code Highlighting

The blog supports syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Adding Images

Add images using standard Markdown:

## Creating Lists

### Ordered Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to highlight important quotes or callouts.

## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## What's Next

The blog infrastructure is set up. You can now:

1. Create new `.mdx` files in the `content/` directory
2. Write your content in Markdown
3. Deploy and share with the world!

Happy writing! ✍️
